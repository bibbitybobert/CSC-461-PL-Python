# Python Project

## Description
This Project is used to learn python in my Programming Languages class.
Here is the description given by my proff:
```
We will create a class diagram during lecture. You must use this diagram to code your project. This will
be tested only on Python 3.11.
Overview
You will be coding a river lock simulator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(water_navigation) ). To
keep the project size reasonable, there will only be one river, with boats only going up river. You will
also only add boats at the mouth of the river. A boat will travel the river based on its engine power and
lockâ€™s behavior, which must be set using the strategy pattern.
Reminder: private/public variable rules still apply in python! You can search for public variables with
regex (self\.[a-zA-Z]+[^)(] ?=)
I am providing you with RunTests.py, ColorText.py (used only to better mark discrepancies), and
MainStarter.py files that will add difference tests. RunTests.py and MainStarter.py must be inside your
lastName_firstName package. Your grade will be based on these tests. ColorText.py is at the same level
as your package folder.
MainStarter.py has a main() function that the tests use to start up your project. Therefore, you must
begin your code in the provided main() function. RunTests.py works like it did in Java. Run this file and
the tests will run. Run from MainStarter.py, and it will run as normal. In order to run redirected IO in
python with extra newlines for readability, there is a custom input function that should be used rather
than input(...). It is cleanInput(...). Use is the same as input(...)
